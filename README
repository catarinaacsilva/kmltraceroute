kmltraceroute
=============

Tool to create geo-referenced TCP traceroutes in KML format for
visualization on a map/globe.  It can only handle IPv4 routes.

It uses GeoIP for geolocalization of IP data.  The GeoLiteCity.dat
file can be downloaded from
<URL: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/ >.

KML files can be viewed using <URL: http://ivanrublev.me/kml/ >,
OpenLayers, Google Earth and other tools.

Note, the geolocation of IP addresses is notoriously hard, as it
change over time and server hosting can be dynamic and change without
any visual changes to the network addresses.  In other words, take the
resulting KML file with a grain of salt..

Dependencies (Debian package names in []):

  geoip [geoip-bin], tcptraceroute [tcptraceroute], host [bind9-host],
  sudo [sudo]
